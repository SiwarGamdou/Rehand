# Rehand project

Welcome to Rehand! this project is a mobile app designed to control your smart glove using IoT. This experience, was my first-ever Flutter, PCB design and IoT project and also my end-of-studies project! ðŸŽ“

# Overview

Traditional muscle recovery methods can be difficult and unmotivating, leading the patients to ignore their rehabilitation exercises which can slow their progress. To solve this challenge, we created Rehand, a mobile application created with Flutter and Firebase, associated with a smart glove that transforms muscle recovery into an engaging and enjoyable activity.

# Features

- Firebase Integration: Connecting to Firebase for data storage and real-time updates.
- Chat service : Enable Patients to chat with Healthcare professionals and ask for advice.
- Chat with AI chatbot : Enable Patients to ask AI about their condition.
- Connecting to the smart glove through Internet connection based on the user ID.

# Project Details
This project was a great opportunity for me to learn Flutter and dive into the world of IoT, mobile applications and PCB design. It's been a fantastic learning experience, and I'm proud to present this app as the result of my hard work and dedication.
